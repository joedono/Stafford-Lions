title: Peace Poster Contest 2024
---
The Stafford Lions Club Peace Poster Contest is upon us! The deadline to drop off completed posters at the Stafford Library is November 1, 2024, before 5:00pm.

Children who will be 11, 12, or 13 on November 15, 2024 are eligible to enter.

The theme this year is "Peace Without Limits". Posters must be no smaller than 11" x 20" and no larger than 20" x 24". Only one entry per child. All artwork must be the individual student's original creation. Duplications are not accepted. All media are accepted, although chalk, charcoal, pastels, and similar must be sealed with a fixative spray to prevent smearing. **Do not laminate entries**.

The winner of our district's contest will be entered into the Lions Club International Poster Contest, with the potential to win the grand prize of $5,000.

As an additional treat, the Stafford Lions Club is partnering with the Stafford Library and their OASIS program. Join us on October 29, 2024 at 6:00pm at the Stafford Library for a night of creativity and crafting to work on your Peace Posters. Children of all ages are welcome to participate in the poster creation during the OASIS event, but only children ages 11, 12, and 13 can enter their posters into the Peace Poster Contest.
