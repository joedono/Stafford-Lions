title: Peace Poster Contest 2024
---
Join the Stafford Lions Club this October 29, 2024, at 6:00pm, in conjunction with the Stafford Library for our annual Peace Poster contest!!

We're partnering with the Stafford Library's OASIS program. Kids of all ages are invited to the art night, but only kids aged 11, 12, or 13 can participate in the contest.

The theme for the posters this year is "Peace Without Limits." This event offers an opportunity for you and others to discuss what peace looks like from the eyes of your child. The winner of our contest will be entered into our international contest, where the overall winner will receive a $5,000 cash prize.
