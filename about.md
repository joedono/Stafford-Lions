## About the Stafford Lions Club
The Stafford Lions Club has been an active community member since 1952, serving our community, our country, and the world - the Lions Club aims to make a World of Difference.

Lions Club International was founded in 1917, in Chicago. Its purpose was to promote charity and good will. Today, it is the world's largest service club organization with over 1.4 million members in more than 200 countries.

Our slogan, **WE SERVE**, reflects the true meaning of Lionism. Lions have been reaching out to those in need, working with the blind and visually impaired, sponsoring education programs, and supporting diabetes research.

Members of the Stafford Lions Club have made a special effort these past years to be a visible and positive force in the community. Your neighbor might be a Lion - you could be a Lion!

## How The Lions Club Started

In 1917, Melvin Jones, a Chicago business leader, told members of his local business club they should reach beyond business issues and address the betterment of their communities and the world. Jones' group, the Business Circle f Chicago, agreed. After contacting similar groups around the United States, an organizational meeting was held on June 7, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The new group took the name of one of the invited groups, the "Association of Lions Clubs," and a national convention was held in Dallas, Texas, USA in October of that year. A constitution, by-laws, objects and a code of ethics were approved. Within three years, Lions became an international organization. Since then, we've earned high marks for both integrity and transparency. We're a well-run organization with a steady vision, a clear mission, and a long – and proud – history.
