We need photos representing all seasons. Photos are due by **August 1, 2023**. Email your photo to [StaffordCtLions@gmail.com](mailto:StaffordCtLions@gmail.com).

Photos must be landscape (that is wider than high). Photos must be a minimum of 3000x2250 pixels (usually at least 6.5 MB). We have recâ€™d photos in the past which while beautiful, could not be used because they were either in portrait mode or the resolution was not sufficient for printing approximately at 10x7 inches.
