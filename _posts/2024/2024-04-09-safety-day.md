Don't miss the fun and educational activities children and their families can enjoy at the upcoming "3rd Annual Stafford Child Safety Day" being organized by West Stafford School. This free (rain or shine) event will be held on Saturday, May 18th from 2:00-4:00pm at Stafford High School located at 145 Orcuttville Road in Stafford Springs, CT.

Stafford Child Safety Day will offer three dozen groups featuring interactive vehicle displays including police cruisers, fire trucks, an ambulance, a high-tech satellite truck, several military vehicles, an environmental display, an aerial drone demonstration, and an ice cream truck. In addition, check out the CT State Police's "Trooper Two" helicopter (weather permitting)!

Children and their families will also experience many safety and wellness groups featuring information on railroad safety, injury prevention, poison control, healthy relationships, impaired driving awareness, mental health resources, early childhood education, vision screenings (**By the Stafford Lions Club**), aerial drone awareness, community resources and free Child ID Kits.

In addition, join us to celebrate the retirement of Stafford Police Department's K-9 Loki. Children are invited to make a card for Loki and thank him for his years of service to our community.

In fair weather, the event will be held on the field in front of the high school's entrance. In poor weather, the event will be moved indoors to the back entrance utilizing the high school's cafeteria and adjacent hallways. Parking will be available at Stafford High School, Stafford Elementary School and Stafford Middle School. A free shuttle bus will be provided for those who park at Stafford Elementary School and Stafford Middle School. No parking will be allowed along Orcuttville Road, Levinthal Run, County Road or in the Stafford Public Library's parking lot.
