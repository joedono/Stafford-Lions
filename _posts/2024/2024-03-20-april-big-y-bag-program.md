It's almost time for Stafford Lions Club to start benefiting from the Big Y Community Bag Program! Let everyone know to buy a reusable Community Bag starting April 1st at:

87 West Stafford Road Rte 190  
Stafford Springs CT

Not sure where to begin? Make sure your staff, volunteers and supporters know that for every $2.50 reusable Community Bag purchased throughout April 2024 at your selected location, Stafford Lions Club will receive $1. This is a great way to broaden awareness and help our cause. More than $420,000 has been donated to almost 1,900  nonprofit organizations since the program launched in January 2019.
