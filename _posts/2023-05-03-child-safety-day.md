The Stafford Lions Club will be at Child Safety Day organized by the Stafford Public Schools. Many emergency services and local services will be there showcasing their vehicles and answering questions by the students. Everything from the police, the firefighters, the EMTs, animal control, and even the military.

The Stafford Lions Club will be providing medical eye screening to the students. Our Welch Spot Screener takes a picture of a person's eyes and detects several vision issues the person may be afflicted with, such as astigmatism. We'll then print out a report for the person to take to their doctor to follow up on potentially detected issues.
