title: Big Y Community Bag Program

We are excited to announce that Stafford Lions Club has been selected again as a nonprofit partner in the Big Y Community Bag Program for September 2025. When you purchase a $2.50 reusable bag at the Big Y on West Stafford Road, $1.00 is donated to the Stafford Lions Club, which then goes to one of the many charitable causes we support.
