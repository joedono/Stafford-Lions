The Stafford Lions Club will be selling our 2024 calendars at a booth at the Stafford Farm Day this year. Come down and experience a taste of the origins of Stafford as a farming town. Admission is free. The proceeds from the calendars we sell wil go towards various charities in the area.

Farm Day is September 10, 2023 from 9:30am - 4:30pm at John Julian Heritage Park in Stafford, CT.

EDIT: Due to the impending rain and the fact that we're selling a paper product, the Lions club will not have a booth at Stafford Farm Day 2023.
